If both of following cases are valid:
- There's *no other documented way* of adding said object in game
- Original game files are stored in assetBundle,

then it's likely you'll have to create own AssetBundle as well and load it in your game yourself.

For that, you might need to get [[Unity version|Unity Editor]] and compile AssetBundle on your own (i might add tutorial soon)
ooor
ill try to verify if it works 
and if you can create fresh bundles with it :D

In worst cases, ask someone in modding channel to do it for you
Or ask me, I don't mind

## for rest stuff
custom sprites: custom sprites section from slug graphics 
regionkit also adds atlas / sprite support

sounds: some can be added unencrypted
