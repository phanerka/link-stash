## Environmental music
im pr sure its hard af just like shaders in game OAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH
OOOR
its just like sound effects but with extra steps? (`soundeffects/ambient`)
loadedsoundeffects/ambient is where all songs are "located"
and `music/songs/####.ogg` wont work right?

FUCK YOU GAME ILL FIGURE OUT MYSELF AND MAKE IT WORK 
FIGHT ME ðŸ˜
