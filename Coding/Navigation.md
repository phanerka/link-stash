**Heyo and welcome to  ==ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ *coding hell* ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥==**  
**I'm sure you will enjoy your stay** Ê•OÏ‰OÊ”

------------------------

Jokes aside, I don't think I can help much.  
If lediting is very vague and yet most of topics are somehow covered here, then fully documenting coding is almost impossible.  
for dnspy and debugging tools, go to debugging. for getting started, go to getting started. Most basic guides are marked with exclamation mark.
In general, keep in mind the following pages:  
- [[Clarifications]] page for documented illogical / non obvious base RW code
- [[Other mods|Exploring other mods]] page to look up how other mods implemented X feature  
- [[Getting started#Useful links|Useful links]] section for the list of tutorials and wikis thats might come in handy

And don't be afraid to ask in discord servers!!
