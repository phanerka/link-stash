**Heyo and welcome to  ==ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ *coding hell* ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥==**

------------------------

Jokes aside, I don't think I can help much.  
If lediting is very vague and yet most of topics are somehow covered here, then fully documenting coding is almost impossible.  
for dnspy and debugging tools, go to debugging. for getting started, go to getting started. Most basic guides are marked with exclamation mark.
In general, keep in mind following pages:  
- [[Code|Exploring code]] page for documented illogical / non obvious base RW code
- [[Other mods|Exploring other mods]] page to look up how other mods implemented X feature  

and dont be afraid to ask in discord servers!!
