Jokes aside, I don't think I can help much. 
If lediting is very vague and I somehow managed to cover most of topics, then fully documenting coding is almost impossible.
for dnspy and debugging tools, go to debugging. for getting started, go to getting started. 
In general, I'd recommend to keep in mind following pages:
- [[Code|Exploring code]] page for documented illogical / non obvious base RW code
- [[Technical files#Logs|logs]] page for
- [[Other mods|Exploring other mods]] page to look up how other mods implemented X feature
and dont be afraid to ask in discord servers!!
