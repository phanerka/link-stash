For getting started, go to [[Getting started]]. Most basic guides are marked with exclamation mark.
In general, keep in mind the following pages:
- [[Clarifications]] page for documented illogical / non obvious base RW code
- [[Other mods|Exploring other mods]] page to look up how other mods implemented X feature
- [[Getting started#Useful links|Useful links]] section for the list of tutorials and wikis thats might come in handy

And don't be afraid to ask in Discord servers!!
