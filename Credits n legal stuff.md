AKA better explanation of `LICENSE.txt` with a bit of additions.

Note that website code *itself* retains (quartz? i cant decide yet :( )MkDocs license aka BSD 2-Clause.
# Legal disclaimer in legal thingies
Everything provided here is intended *only* for academic purposes. It's okay to make *free* RW mods based on given knowledge BUT everything else requires permission from respective owners of said resources.  
# Repo modification & distribution
The documentation itself is under `CC-BY-SA 4.0` license. The source code of the website (used to format the documentation) is under `MIT` license (.. for now?).

In simple words about the license:
- Feel free to modify and share this doc somewhere else. But in both cases, you will have to use the same license I have set.
- According to the license, you *have* to credit me on distribution. But let's be real: if you use a piece of information to share with someone without crediting me, I won't sue you and leave you broke for the rest of your life. I genuinely don't care (even if you don't credit me on distribution of a pic I made or *entire doc*) as long as you don't break worse rules. pinky promise ðŸ‘€
- According to the license, you'll have to document all changes you made to the document. But again, I don't care unless something worse happens.
- Note that the documentation uses work of other people, however. They retain own rights, and anything regarding their work requires *their* permissions.
- ~~Not for commercial use. Knowledge should not be paywalled.~~

idk if i should make it non commercial or not. i don't want akupara to legally yoink, possibly extend and sell my documentation without my knowledge.


That being said, personally I don't want this website to be fully merged with Wiki due to multiple reasons:
- it got own, well thought-of way of navigation and formatting, much more fitting for "how to" style of guide
- it accepts unfinished files and guides
- some resources (like archives) are uploaded directly to the server
- it's much easier and comfier for me to locally edit changes in Obsidian than on website
- owning website gives me more freedom in writing style than wiki would allow to (using "you"/"me" words, making jokes, writing info more casually)

Wiki is good as it is overall, as place of exhaustively described features in mods/game.

The rule doesn't apply to moving *part of info* to wiki, though. Please reach me out if you do so, so that info won't be duped here and there.

# Credits  
I credited people here:  
 - whose guides/words were copied due to info in Discord servers being not very easy to access  
 - who weren't directly credited neither had source link to their message

However, if you're not happy with your info being added here / want to be credited separately, still / I forgot to credit you, reach me out. We'll figure things out.
