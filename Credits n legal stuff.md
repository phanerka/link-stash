AKA better explanation of `LICENSE.txt` with a bit of additions.

Note that website code *itself* retains MkDocs license aka BSD 2-Clause.
# Legal disclaimer in legal thingies
Everything provided here is intended _only_ for academic purposes. It's okay to make *free* RW mods based on given knowledge BUT everything else requires permission from respective owners of said resources.  
# Repo modification & distribution
I'm fine with some info being modified / being shared. Crediting AND notifying me is nice but isn't required.  
Same rules apply to entire repo / website. If i stop updating it, feel free to fork it and post it somewhere else.  
And again, just keep following others' rules, please. *Don't be a dick.*

That being said, I don't want this website to be fully merged with Wiki due to multiple reasons:
- it got own, well thought-of way of navigation and formatting, much more fitting for "how to" style of guide
- it accepts unfinished files and guides
- some resources (like archives) are uploaded directly to the server
- it's much easier and comfier for me to locally edit changes in Obsidian than on website
- i can make jokes here without worries ehe  

Wiki is good as it is overall, as place of exhaustively described features in mods/game.

Note that, I'll repeat myself, that doesn't apply to moving part of info to wiki. Please reach me out if you do so, so that info won't be duped here and there.

# Credits  
I credited people here:  
 - whose guides/words were copied due to info in Discord servers being not very easy to access  
 - who weren't directly credited neither had source link to their message

However, if you're not happy with your info being added here / want to be credited separately, still / I forgot to credit you, reach me out. We'll figure things out.
