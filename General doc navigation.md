If you're new and want to learn how to make/add X, in general I'd advise to:
- (if you're completely new to modding) head to "Getting started" page and only then, check other guides
- check the *top guide / video tutorial*, *read / watch it from start to end* to get acknowledged with basics, and only *then* read the rest of page to see how you can change things yourself. I don't know your way of thinking, but otherwise you might feel confused and overwhelmed with all definitions and parameters!

# Locating files
All local links are leading from `Steam` or `Rain World` folders, unless specified.
For `your-mod` folder, refer to this.

### Rain World folder
RW location.
Default path:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Rain World`

How to find:
right click Rain World in Steam: `Manage` -> `Browse local files` 

### Tags  
~~For convenient looking for information.~~
My initial idea was to make tags mark not *entire page* but only headers. However, it seems a bit hard to implement that, so tags aren't that useful tbh.
- `#utils` - helpful RW-related plugins, apps and websites
- `#wiki` - Wiki and UserWiki documentation
- `#docs` - non-Wiki documentation
- `#vids` - video guides
- `#sheets` - spreadsheets for cross-mod support
- `#templates` - mod and room templates
- dependencies:
	- `#msc` - More Slugcats Expansion AKA Downpour DLC
	- `#watcher` - Watcher DLC
	- `#crs` - Custom Regions Support mod
	- `#regionKit` - RegionKit mod

### Discord server links  
> [!warning] Warning: Discord links work only on Windows.

For the sake of convenience, every discord server channel has got both links for browser and the app (mentioned as ``| D`` ). Example:  
``https://discord.com/channels/1083481230839922688/1083511643113279519`` (original link)  
``discord://discord.com/channels/1083481230839922688/1083511643113279519`` (app link)  
it's your choice what link to use.

For servers names abbreviation explanations, refer to [[Source#Discord servers|this]].
