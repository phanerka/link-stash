If you're new and want to learn how to make/add X, in general I'd advise to:
- (if you're completely new to modding) head to "Getting started" page and only then, check other guides
- check the *top guide / video tutorial*, *read / watch it from start to end* to get acknowledged with basics, and only *then* read the rest of page to see how you can change things yourself. I don't know your way of thinking, but otherwise you might feel confused and overwhelmed with all definitions and parameters!

### clarifications idk?
should i make separate devtools page?  
also add here on modification  

also need to remind bout devtools being enabled requirement every setup.txt mention 


To avoid confusion, ill call every file that is put into modify folder "modification file of X" (X with modification syntax?)  
its very easy to miss out that folder in path.  

should mention dev tools clarification? maybe

i think i also should clarify this v
and clean up pages

Remix mod ID: `henpemaz_rainmeadow`
Workshop mod ID: `3388224007`

[[DNSpy]]: fix locations TODO
cause i need unified path system i think

probably should make certain variable definitions across document, aka 
`%your-mod-path%`
`%file-path%`
`%StreamingAssets%`
etc.

make separate "file location" page in "general knowledge" folder and the info above ^ in it too? and reference the page here?
and put locating rw folder and steam folder there too?
