# New to modding?
If you're new and want to learn how to change / add X, in general I'd advise to:
- (if you're completely new to modding) head to "Getting started" page and only then, check other guides
- check the *top guide / video tutorial*, *read / watch it from start to end* to get acknowledged with basics, and only *then* read the rest of page to see how you can change things yourself. I don't know your way of thinking, but otherwise you might feel confused and overwhelmed with all definitions and parameters!

If you don't know where to find game files, check [[Game data location|this]] page.
## Root folders overview

Two biggest sections are dedicated to region/room and code mods. Excluding slugcat skin mods, they make up the majority of Workshop mods, and they've got the most of gimmicks required to be covered.
- **Lediting** covers adding and changing rooms and regions in game, and got all info related to level editor and (related to room/region making) Dev Tools.
	It's absolutely possible to make a good modded region without coding knowledge at all: the main challenge is usually figuring out folder and file structure.
	Also, it got section dedicated to level editor creation.... for all nerds out there.
- **Coding** is all about, well, coding and everything around it: how to set up, how to debug, how to read logs. Rain World is written in C#, meaning it's highly recommended to be aware of at least language basics basics.

There are 2 more folders that might come in handy in either case:
- **General modding knowledge** covers info that could be good to keep in mind during making *any* kind of mod. It's not important to know everything from there; mostly, it just provides information for advanced kind of stuff.
- **Exploring contents** got all info about in-game objects and assets; got all kinds of previews and guides how to explore them on your own.

The rest are pretty niche but were still worth being mentioned; note that they do not need code to work, just like region mods.
- **Music making**: got requirements for music files to be recognized by the game, and a bit of info about how in-game music was created. 
- **Drawing**: got references and tips on how to make good assets for the game. Creating a slugcat skin page is also there.
- **Translating**: covers *changing* in-game lines and assets for translation purposes.
# Looking for a resource?
i tried my best to make searching process as quick as possible.
- Most of root folders have got "Resources" folder. It contains all tagged resources in there.
- Don't remember which folder contains the tagged resource you need? Just search it! Enter the tag first, then everything else.

### Tags
~~For convenient looking for information.~~
~~My initial idea was to make tags mark not *entire page* but only headers. However, it seems a bit hard to implement that, so tags aren't that useful tbh.~~
i think i figured out how to use tags well. Hooray! :D
- `#utils` - helpful RW-related plugins, apps and websites
- `#wiki` - Wiki and UserWiki pages
- `#docs` - non-Wiki documentation
- `#vids` - video guides
- `#sheets` - spreadsheets that are *intended to be edited* for cross-mod compatibility
- `#templates` - mod and room templates
- `#previews` - list of game features shown in a single spot
- dependencies:
	- `#msc` - More Slugcats Expansion AKA Downpour DLC
	- `#watcher` - Watcher DLC
	- `#crs` - Custom Regions Support mod
	- `#regionKit` - RegionKit mod

### Discord server links
> [!warning] Warning: Discord links work only on Windows.

For the sake of convenience, every discord server channel has got both links for browser and the app (mentioned as ``| D`` ). Example:
``https://discord.com/channels/1083481230839922688/1083511643113279519`` (original link)
``discord://discord.com/channels/1083481230839922688/1083511643113279519`` (app link)
it's your choice what link to use.

For servers names abbreviation explanations, refer to [[Source#Discord servers|this]].

# FAQ
 *"Why download links are looking weird?"*
 Discord download links are bad, since they expire after a short amount of time.
 I upload the files *only* to storage provided for the website and *never* tweak files with malicious intent. In case of concern, it's always possible to 
	 a) download files from source messages attached to them
	 b) make the file on your own using the guides I attach. 
If it becomes impossible to download some file, please let me know.

*"Moving to Wiki?"*
Refer to the bottom of [[Credits n legal stuff#Repo modification & distribution|this]] header.

*"Moving to `github.io`"*?
idk tbh. Originally I got to Vercel because 
- uh.... it was top method in a guide for website deployment
- I needed to privately share the website, since I was afraid of getting backlash because I put the links before asking for permission.
And when I went to public... idk... there's no reason to move to Github, really. Also, would have to think of unused nice and short username for good link.

*"Cookies? Analytics?"*
No. Disabled. Idc at all.
There's too little info stored locally, only "what checkboxes are checked" and "the structure of website".

*"Why can't I find the website on Google / DuckDuckGo / any other search engine?"*
Web crawlers are forbidden from visiting this website, as it contains a lot of sensitive info.
