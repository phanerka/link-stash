Navigation on Coding folder: [[Coding/Navigation|here]]

If you're new and want to learn how to make/add X, in general I'd advise to:
- (if you're completely new to modding) head to "Getting started" page and only then, check other guides
- check the *top guide / video tutorial*, *read / watch it from start to end* to get acknowledged with basics, and only *then* read the rest of page to see how you can change things yourself. I don't know your way of thinking, but otherwise you might feel confused and overwhelmed with all definitions and parameters!

### clarifications idk?
should i make separate devtools page?  
also add here on modification  

To avoid confusion, ill call every file that is put into modify folder "modification file of X" (X with modification syntax?)  
its very easy to miss out that folder in path.
