Whoa, that will take a lot of time and effort... but, good luck!   

Regarding mod folder structure, refer to [[Mod structure]] (duh).

## Region files
**List of ALL files for proper region making:**
https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Creating_A_Region

Below is a list of *just some of them* with clarifications.
#### world_xx.txt  
The only file that is **required** for region to work.  
It's settings can be viewed by opening Dev Tools interface, in [Map](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Dev_Tools#tabber-tabpanel-Map-0) tab.  

https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/World_File_Format  #wiki
**Always** has to use the following [format](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/World_File_Format#Format).


> [!warning] Note on using world editors
> Please think of them as a way to *help with* `world_xx.txt` file making, not a way to *make* it. 
> It's advised to learn how to make world file on your own since:
> - this file is one of the most (if not the most) important region-related files and is part of region making fundamental knowledge
> - you *will* have to use that knowledge at least once for a proper region (and world editor won't help in this case)
> - most of room-breaking errors are caused by improper configuration of `world_xx.txt` file.

Can be created with FloodForge (?)  

Responsible for:  
- defining [[0*. Room types|room types]] via tag (shelters, gates, etc.)  
- connecting rooms  
	Can be customized for various slugcat campaigns\*, via conditional links ([Wiki page](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Downpour_Reference/File_Formats#world_xx.txt), [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQfZwHSxNTA))  
> [!Warning] Warning on room connections
> tbh i'm surprised it's not mentioned in wiki.  
> Connections count starts from **top left corner** of the room and is read by lines (not columns!)
> Lever editor Rained can show pipe numbers... somewhere. wawa
- setting up creature spawns  
	May contain additional creature flags ([Creature Flags](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/World_File_Format#Creature_Flags) section on Wiki page)  
	Can be customized for various slugcat campaigns\* (the bottom of [Creature Spawns](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/World_File_Format#Creature_Spawns) section on Wiki page)
	Note that batflies' spawning is defined by room tags, not this section.
> [!warning] Warning on creature spawns  
> Region creature spawns settings are read only **once**, when you enter the region for the first time. Afterwards, they're read from your save.  
> To apply new creature spawns settings, you can:  
> 1) install [Spawn Resetter](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3232143310) mod (press `BACKSPACE` while dev tools is enabled to activate)   
> 2) wipe your save and enter the region again.  
> 3) add `clean spawns` line in [[Cheat codes|setup.txt]]  
- preventing batflies to enter specific room  

\* Slugcats have to be named in own way, which might differ from in-game name:
> [!example]- List of slugcat naming
> - Monk: `Yellow`
> - Survivor: `White`
> - Hunter: `Red`
> - Artificer: `Artificer`
> - Gourmand: `Gourmand`
> - Rivulet: `Rivulet`
> - Spearmaster: `Spear`
> - Saint: `Saint`
> - ???: `Inv`
