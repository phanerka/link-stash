# Making palette image
There are 3 ways:
- via Palette Creator mod (which is broken atm :c)
- by combining existing palette and fade palette in main Dev Tool interface ( #regionKit required)
- manually

# Adding palette in the game
Put your new palette in `your-mod\palettes\` folder, named as `paletteN.png`, where N is a number.
Make sure to give unique number to palette to not override other palettes by accident!
