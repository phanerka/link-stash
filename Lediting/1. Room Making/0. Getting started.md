### What to download
- level editor: [link to a list of them](https://solaristheworstcatever.github.io/Repo-Site/extras.html#leditors)
It explains differences between editors pretty well. Personally I use **Rained** ([manual](https://pkhead.github.io/rained/en/)). It has got good balance between "good UI" and "up-to-date".
**General level editor guide: [Wiki page](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Level_Editor)**
- preview of lediting features (tiles, props, effects):
  - [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1mDhiQAi7CHkGy0Fd6Oi0s8tOZr7H152-) (source: [RWMA](https://discord.com/channels/1083481230839922688/1083506128010358915/1210363538397331567))
  - updated list of effect previews (source: [RW Main](https://discord.com/channels/291184728944410624/838185248981385256/1322828255190843412))
- a bunch of [[Lediting/Useful mods list#Must-haves|must-have mods]]

*Note that for the following sections, you don't need to download every single resource: just take what you liked from first glance and stick with it. Picking the first one only also woks.*

![[Region templates]]


### Basic tutorials
For first lediting attempt, you'd want to start from very basics: create a simple room and [[2. Adding the room in game/|put it in the game]].
Here's the list of guides:
- ["Region From The Ground Up"](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Region_From_The_Ground_Up) - a Wiki page that covers room (yes, *ROOM*) creation in details
- [YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjpSIxcbpH0) on room creation, by `GalacticBeanSoup`- a pretty short guide on adding a room for a new region; uses `RWE+` as leditor.
	Good enough if you want to just make silly rooms.
	*(but i plead you do NOT download visual studio just to edit silly room files)*
- videos 1 + 2 (+3, optionally) from [YT playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOpeR3bQUKEJIGBJ3TATHBLmNvZwyYioT), by `Ludocrypt` - an exhaustive guide on modern RW region modding; uses `Rained` as leditor.
	Recommended if you're planning to make a region in the future.

### How to git gud
General suggestion is to explore original game rooms and get acknowledged with what materials are used, what materials go well, etc.
- [YT lediting guide by Kaeporo](https://youtu.be/YQ0DO-fmPCE) - an oldie but goldie.
	While it uses official level editor (which is very buggy and not recommended to use at all), it showcases:
	- common practices used in lediting
	- leditor keybinds (which are shared across all level editors)
	- quick overview of Dev Tools and level editor features
- https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Architecture_of_Rain_World
- Top of [old RW modding wiki page](https://github.com/Rain-World-Modding/Rain-World-Modding.github.io/blob/main/pages/region-development/level-editor/Effect-Editor.md)
	remember, [No Fandom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Russian)
- uh you can check [[Generally used tiles n props|my doc]] i guess
You can also take a look at general room creation and probably learn a couple of tricks
- lediting playlists (no more updated ðŸ˜”)
	- [livestream VODs playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_bK2jcLm1oJW4E6dj2GnM_8gWN2n8q73)
	- [lediting timelapses playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_bK2jcLm1oJ8CJuXg7N2xS0uRzGoCMDF)
- [fresh full room creation VOD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoDoDBdaZKw), i guess

### Additional resources
Worthy to be aware of.
- Solar's Warehouse and Github repo
https://solaristheworstcatever.github.io/Repo-Site/index.html
https://github.com/solaristheworstcatever/The-Level-Editor-Warehouse/
Both are very good. They've got a lot of links and files that would come in handy.
If you know what resource you're looking for, you'd probably want to use the Warehouse instead of this website.
