If you're new to lediting, I'd advise to skip this entire section. It's rather for those who want to save time on repetitive tasks.

For more information, refer to [[Cheat codes|this]].
i gotta check if it works tbh, that's just made by looking at wiki
`load game 0` ?
- arena:
```
start screen:0
world:0
level:Warehouse
```
- story:
```
start screen:0
start map SU_A32
```
### Rain disable
There are numerous ways to disable rain for convenient Dev Tooling:
- add `no rain` string to [[Cheat codes|setup.txt]].
- install "[Stuck in a Cycle](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3035801552)" mod (press MAP while paused to toggle)
- \[the laziest no-prep way] press `9` with enabled Dev Mode every time when rain is about to start

### Symlinking
yeah..

> - move everything from leveleditor/Levels to game/Levels or somewhere safe if you want to keep that stuff
> - delete the folder leveleditor/Levels
> - right-click-and-drag game/Levels into the leveleditor folder, "Drop here > Symbolic link"
> - done ??

### room quick reload in story mode (NEED TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS)

in warp menu, shift + click - set as wake up room for next cycle
Enable Dev Mode, press R. You'll appear in shelter, and every room will be reloaded, including yours.
rebind devtools mod: enable "persist between cycles" setting for peak experience?
When youre done, press C with warp menu open to clean shelter settings.
sheltering also works.

oooor go into another room (u can use numpad with enabled dev mode to TP to the pipe entrance you need) and press Q (it will give a food pip AND reload every room except the one you're in)

or enable Warp Menu and warp into the same room you're in
