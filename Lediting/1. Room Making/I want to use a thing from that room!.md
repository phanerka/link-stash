honestly, just ask in any server lmao
but...

Talking bout the rest stuff, there are 4 possible ways how that could be done:
- via Dev Tools
	- If you have access to the room with what you want in game:
		enter the room, open Dev Tools interface and check Objects and Properties tabs
	- If you don't:
		- check Dev Tools [wiki page](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Dev_Tools#Interface_Tabs) and search what you need in "Objects" and "Room Settings" tabs via `Ctrl + F`
		- check [[Lediting/Useful mods list#Dependencies|libraries' docs]]
- via [[Region files#properties.txt|region properties]] (creatures related recoloring)
- with [[Custom palette|custom palettes]] (recoloring pipes / sky / water / acid, room-wide color manipulation)
	If you have access to the room, open Dev Tools interface in it, try changing palettes (main palette, fade palette, accent colors) and see if color of what you need changes
- in very rare cases, its configured via code (like progress bar for gates)
