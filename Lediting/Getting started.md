### What to download  
- level editor: [link to a list of them](https://seroen.github.io/Seroens-Repo/info.html)  
It explains differences between editors pretty well. Personally I use **Rained** ([manual](https://pkhead.github.io/rained/en/)). It has got good balance between "good UI" and "up-to-date".   

**General level editor guide: [Wiki page](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Level_Editor)**
- preview of lediting features (tiles, props, effects):
  - [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1mDhiQAi7CHkGy0Fd6Oi0s8tOZr7H152-) (source: [RWMA](https://discord.com/channels/1083481230839922688/1083506128010358915/1210363538397331567))
  - updated list of effect previews (source: [RW Main](https://discord.com/channels/291184728944410624/838185248981385256/1322828255190843412))
- (optional) example mod [zip file link from discord](https://nqywadcmwusjqlrg.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/notes/files/lediting/regionTemplate-uSyLk5ZX5XkDsNsaUn9NeCVu0Gz1lf.zip) (source: [RWMA](https://discord.com/channels/1083481230839922688/1083506128010358915/1268631425532563496)) #templates
- a bunch of [[Lediting/Useful mods list#Must-haves|must-have mods]]

### Basic tutorials
For first lediting attempt, you'd want to start from very basics: create a simple room and [[preview your room in the game|put it in the game]].
- ["Region From The Ground Up"](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Region_From_The_Ground_Up) - a Wiki page that covers room (yes, *ROOM*) creation in details
- [up-to-date YT video playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOpeR3bQUKEJIGBJ3TATHBLmNvZwyYioT) - covers a lot of topics, worth to just check if it's got the ones you need
(but please i plead you do NOT download visual studio just to edit silly room files)

### How to git gud
General suggestion is to explore original game rooms and get acknowledged with what materials are used, what materials go well, etc.  
- https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Architecture_of_Rain_World
- Top of [old RW modding wiki page](https://github.com/Rain-World-Modding/Rain-World-Modding.github.io/blob/main/pages/region-development/level-editor/Effect-Editor.md)
	remember, [No Fandom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Russian)
- uh you can check [[Generally used tiles n props|my doc]] i guess
You can also take a look at general room creation and probably learn a couple of tricks
- lediting playlists (no more updated ðŸ˜”)  
	- [livestream VODs playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_bK2jcLm1oJW4E6dj2GnM_8gWN2n8q73)  
	- [lediting timelapses playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_bK2jcLm1oJ8CJuXg7N2xS0uRzGoCMDF)

### Additional resources
- Seroen's Warehouse and Github repo

https://github.com/Seroen/Seroens-Repo-Files  
Both are very good. They've got a lot of links and files that would come in handy.
