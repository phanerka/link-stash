When you finish the region, you'll likely want its map to be shared.

Check this and reach out Alduris to post your region map. 

##### Map exporter beta  
> Makes interactive maps. The interface is in the remix menu. Instructions are included there, but here's the general gist of things:  
> 1. Run the screenshotter for the regions/slugcats of your choice.  
> 2. Use the editor to edit the map in case of overlapping or unpositioned rooms. The map takes from the dev view map in dev tools, NOT the canon view (in-game map).  
> 3. Run the generator to turn the map into tiles.  
> 4. Run the local server in the export tab to view it in-browser. The export feature is not done yet.  
>   
> Permalink to download the latest version of the beta: https://github.com/alduris/MapExporter/releases/latest  
> If you receive an error or the screenshotter stops running without closing, please upload LogOutput.log, LogOutput.log.1, and, if it exists, exceptionLog.txt
