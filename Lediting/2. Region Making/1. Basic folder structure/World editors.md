> [!warning] Note on using world editors
> Please think of them as a way to *help with* `world_xx.txt` file making, not a way to *make* it. 
> It's advised to learn how to make world file on your own since:
> - this file is one of the most (if not the most) important region-related files and is part of region making fundamental knowledge
> - you *will* have to use that knowledge at least once for a proper region (and world editor won't help in this case)
> - most of room-breaking errors are caused by improper configuration of `world_xx.txt` file.
