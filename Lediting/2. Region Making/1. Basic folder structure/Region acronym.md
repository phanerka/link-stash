Acronym is a very short set of letters that works as region identifier in game code.
All region acronyms MUST be unique; 2 different regions with same acronyms are incompatible with each other and, if enabled together, will break the game.

Due to long-lasting previous limitations, using only 2 letters as region acronym is very common practice; however since v1.10, the limitation was removed.
