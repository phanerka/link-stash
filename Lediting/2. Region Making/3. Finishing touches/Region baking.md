just a friendly reminder to [bake](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Creating_A_Region#Baking) your rooms.
You can also bake via Remix menu in RegionKit

debug world doesnt work with unbaked regions btw

%% why is info duped sometimes tho? %%

On region load, if line `10` contains ONLY `0` (which means there is no data), then lines `10` and `11` will be replaced with empty data.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
