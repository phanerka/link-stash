> [!warning] That's not entire list. Some mods are more niche and mentioned in "How-to"s

##### Must-haves  
- Dev Tools ([[Dev Tools|main page]]): a classic. You cannot finish a room without Dev Tools. Literally.
- [Custom Region Support](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2941565790) ([docs](https://github.com/Bro748/Custom-Regions/tree/dp-release), older version of which were yoinked to [wiki](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Custom_Regions_Support) *bruh*): aside from providing features to make a decent region (custom pearls, threat music, landscape art), adds a separate log which helps with game crashes / freezes troubleshooting during room creation process.   
- [Warp Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920446893) ([Wiki page](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Warp)): allows to teleport to any region / room in game. Extremely useful when adding rooms in Story.

- [Palette Creator](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2959458351): cool thing but broken, unfortunately. Refer "[[Custom palette]]" file for working one.  
- mods that extend max length for region [[Region acronym#Region naming (acronym)|acronym]]:

	- [Region Title Fix](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2998885818): TODO is abandoned? should i get rid of it?  
- [Spawn Resetter](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3232143310): to reset creature spawns in the region. More info [[Region files#world_xx.txt|here]] in second warning block.
