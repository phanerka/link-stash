> [!warning] That's not entire list. Some mods are more niche and mentioned in "How-to"s

##### Must-haves  
- Dev Tools ([[Dev Tools|main page]]): a classic. You cannot finish a room without Dev Tools. Literally.
- [Custom Region Support](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2941565790) ([docs](https://github.com/Bro748/Custom-Regions/tree/dp-release), older version of which were yoinked to [wiki](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Custom_Regions_Support) *bruh*): aside from providing features to make a decent region (custom pearls, threat music, landscape art), adds a separate log which helps with determining errors during room creation process.   
- [Warp Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920446893) ([Wiki page](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Warp)): allows to teleport to any region / room in game. Extremely useful when adding rooms in Story.

- [Stuck in a Cycle](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3035801552): helps to edit the room with Dev Tools without worries that rain will eventually come. More info [[2. preview your room in the game#Rain disable|here]].  
- [Room Screenshot](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3125783486): self-explanatory. For room recording, refer to [[Recording rooms|this]].  
- [Palette Creator](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2959458351): cool thing but broken, unfortunately. Refer "[[create custom palette]]" file for working one.  
- mods that extend max length for region [[TO-DOs#Region naming (acronym)|acronym]]:

	- [Region Title Fix](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2998885818): TODO to be added; is abandoned? should i get rid of it?  
- [Spawn Resetter](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3232143310): to reset creature spawns in the region. More info [[0. Region files#world_xx.txt|here]] in second warning block.

##### Dependencies  
> [!warning] Friendly reminder to add following mods to [[Mod structure|modinfo.json]], if you're going to use them

- [RegionKit](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920439476) ([features](https://github.com/Rain-World-Modding/RegionKit/blob/main/README.md), [docs](https://github.com/Rain-World-Modding/RegionKit/tree/main/docs)): a "unified dependency and object kit"; provides a lot of various features, starting with more room customization and ending with more objects for DevTools.   
- [Lunacy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2930814260) ([docs](https://github.com/Nacu0021/Lunacy)): yet another feature library.  
- [The M4rbelous Entity Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3311812030): new creatures and items pack.  
TODO: should i mention other item/creature mods here or just list to steam workshop?  
or actually... just make foldable list?  
- [Coloured Lanterns](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3401635588):  self-explanatory.
