##### Must-haves  
- Dev Tools ([wiki](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Dev_Tools), [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggpKX6IJVFg), [more exhaustive but incomplete video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49ImiszhCe0)): a classic. You cannot finish a room without Dev Tools. Literally.  
For Dev Tools plugins, check [[Coding/Useful mods list|coding section]].   

> [!info] Clarification on Dev Tools mention across this document  
> "Enable Dev Tools": just enable Dev Tools mod in Remix menu.  
> "Enable Dev Mode": enable Dev Tools, then press O in game.  
> "Open Dev Tool interface": enable Dev Tools, then press O in game, and then press H.

- [Custom Region Support](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2941565790) ([docs](https://github.com/Bro748/Custom-Regions/tree/dp-release), older version of which were yoinked to [wiki](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Custom_Regions_Support) *bruh*): aside from providing features to make a decent region (custom pearls, threat music, landscape art), adds a separate log which helps with determining errors during room creation process.   
- [Warp Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920446893) ([Wiki page](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Warp)): allows to teleport to any room in game. Unless you modify connections to existing rooms, you will have no way to access the one you just added in the game.
