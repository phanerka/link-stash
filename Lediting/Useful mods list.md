> [!warning] Warning on mod dependencies in the collection
> If you subscribe to separate mods, make sure you'll download dependencies as well; Steam doesn't check them on Collections page.

*Mod collection in Steam Workshop is [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3460033646).*

>[!watcher] sorry but watcher ate some of them
> Due to recent update of the game, some mods might not work.
> Confirmed to be broken mods are crossed out. If they stay broken for too long without a way to be fixed, while being potentially useful, they will move to "Cancelled projects" section.

*That's not entire list. Some mods are more niche and mentioned in "How-to"s*
##### Must-haves
- Dev Tools ([[Dev Tools|main page]]): a classic. You cannot finish a room without Dev Tools. Literally.
- [Custom Region Support](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2941565790) ([docs](https://github.com/Bro748/Custom-Regions/tree/dp-release), older version of which were yoinked to [wiki](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Custom_Regions_Support) *bruh*): aside from providing features to make a decent region (custom pearls, threat music, landscape art), adds a separate log which helps with game crashes / freezes troubleshooting during room creation process.
- [Warp Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920446893) (outdated [Wiki page](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Warp)): allows to teleport to any region / room in game. Extremely useful when adding rooms in Story.

##### Recommended
- [Better Decals](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3241776574): allows decals to be more customized.
- [Stuck in a Cycle](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3035801552): helps to edit the room with Dev Tools without worries that rain will eventually come. More info [[2+. Setting up environment#Rain disable|here]].
- [Room Screenshot](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3125783486): self-explanatory. For general room recording topic, refer to [[Recording rooms|this]] page.
- ~~[Palette Creator](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2959458351)~~: allows to easily create palettes. For general palette creation topic, refer to [[Custom palette|this]] page.
- [Spawn Resetter](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3232143310): to reset creature spawns in the region. More info [[Region files#world_xx.txt|here]] in second warning block.

> [!warning] Friendly reminder to add following mods to [[Mod structure|modinfo.json]], if you're going to use them

	In case you hate the little yellow guy in bottom left corner, there's a [mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3141904462) that sends em to the void dimension.
