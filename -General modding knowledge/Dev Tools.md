### Dev Tools plugins
Were made to fix some stuff.
- [Legible Devtools](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933848147) - recolors Dev Tools buttons' color from red to cyan
- [Rebind Dev Tools](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2940372957) - adds keybinds configuration and setting to turn off Dev Mode auto-enabling on cycle start in Story.
