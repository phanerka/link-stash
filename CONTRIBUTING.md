- Try avoiding duplicating information. If you have to use in 2 spots, decide where it's more important, and put a link to it in second spot.  
- ALL info regarding in-game code logic / files / "how to pull out files" goes into "Exploring contents" folder. If it's available online, put into respective "References" file instead.  
- Some information is better that no information. If your doc isn't finished yet, that's alright.  
- I'm not collecting info regarding pre-v1.9 modding. No. I don't want to confuse people with pages for another version of the game. Neither I'm interested in taking care of it, to be honest.  
- Please *always* add source where you found the guide / file. I'm not accepting it otherwise.  
- It's alright to specify some information along with link (to make provided info clearer) or give a bit of summary, it's alright to duplicate resources links from some guide... but it's NOT alright to copy big chunks of text from there.  
	.... unless you can't directly point at said resource with a non-Discord link.  
- sorry but i'm not accepting requests to [[References#Tutorials|drawing tutorials]] section! I've got own standards there and they might conflict with others'. Main point is to have style as close to RW as possible.

All points above are subjects to change.
