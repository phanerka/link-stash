Heyo and welcome to WIP link stash! Hope you will enjoy your stay ʕ●.●ʔ

Before you start with anything, please check [[General doc navigation|navigation]] pages. It might help with searching for what you need!

Entire documentation is made with Obsidian and made into website via [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).  
If you want to have it offline, then sure, get the vault [here](https://github.com/phanerka/link-stash/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)!
> [!warning] Warning: not all files are stored directly in the vault.
> Some are located directly on website; the doc just has a download link to them.
### Disclaimers  
This website WON'T:  
 - replace official modding wiki. Instead, it directs to appropriate wiki pages and adds remarks (from personal notes or messages i read in the servers), if such haven't been found there  
 - even try to hide any kinds of game spoilers. *You've been warned.*
	 However, it doesn't concern Watcher. For some time, all Watcher related content is hidden with spoilers.
 - provide "step by step" exhaustive guides (although a lot of effort has been done to make guides cover as many issues as possible).  
 - explain vague and non-RW related topics like "how to draw" or "how to code". That stuff is up to you.  
 - have any information regarding v1.5 modding. And it's not planned to to be added. The doc MAY contain some v1.5 guides but ONLY if they still provide some useful information for v1.10 modding.
 
------

And.. a lil note. I'll leave it here for some time. Maybe will delete later.

Okay so, I'm not very experienced in modding, thus there *might* be some mistakes.   
This website was born from my annoyance over numerous "why wasn't that file / guide posted in THAT server / channel?!" moments, which later grew into just a dump of all cool info I find.   
And making that website did help me to learn and get better acquainted with RW modding in general, so I don't regret anything.   

If there's any need to contact me, the info is left in [[Credits n legal stuff|credits]]. 


Contributions are welcome, of course. 



Anyway,  
	enjoy.
